                To be honest, my inspiration came out of nowhere. I was just chilling on the canape a couple years ago,
                when i came across a youtuber named 'Bro Code'. That's when it all started. I decided to click on his channel and well,
                that was it. I started by watching the Python course he had, which was a 12 hour video amazingly.
                From then, day by day, i watched tutorials and practised at the same time, in order to not forget what i learnt.
                And that's how it all started!<hr color="black"><br><br>
